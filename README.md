# Created with Create React App

 - I chose not to go for invasive library but to concentrate on showing some css and basic level css and knowledge.
 - App should work on smartphone rather nicely
 - I used mui/system because of its extensability and modularity
 - Couldn't get the post working (although I receive a 200, so I simulated the addition of a dev)
